00:00-00:30
euonym let's just start right with weird words 
00:30-01:00
supposed to question when you spoke it off in your career but how important was for you at the Young America and you said there's no other country where you could have achieved what you've achieved today when you look at the US been a landscape would that still apply in 2020 and in our we broadly by doing everything we should be doing foster. Same environment has brought you 
01:00-01:30
you're so great with respect to evasion and Foster not no show stores for break I think we don't be complacent and we wanted to say hi okay how can we make it better over time and I think we want to be cautious about the gradual cream of Regulation and bureaucracy are Immortal and if we keep making more of a year and do not do something about removing them 
01:30-02:00
eventually we'll be able to do nothing important and I appreciate the lottery each year us I think we have a state-level yeah well I want to talk about that because you never been I mean you've been working with government business with government now 
02:00-02:30
British government and where should be hands-off what's ideal I love the time but best thing I can do is just get out of the way and so that I'd say that's the best 
02:30-03:00
then after that would be ensuring that there are not artificial monopolies and that that there is a fertile ground for startups and what can happen overtime as I can get regulatory capture by large companies where they influence the rat The Regulators in the legislators to favor there and their situation I need have a purse the Redwoods and you just can't 
03:00-03:30
a little little trees can grow smaller companies and startups sport but they will only try to work assistant that is in general 
03:30-04:00
the way we think of things from say capitalism vs communism answer but I think this is so it doesn't get no position, nor or or on Commercial have good feedback loop for the customer weather instead of the people as a whole or early customers are 
04:00-04:30
a response to their customer and if they're Monopoly they're going to have to wake his response was that responding to the customers being a people is that there are monopolies that can't go bankrupt or usually cannot go bankrupt so there's not there's not really a tete-a-tete cleansing process or government go to the catastrophe 
04:30-05:00
this is not a general problem 
05:00-05:30
I made it to work and say you know how many how many candy companies are there so it's like one last time there was some good candy you know we were supposed to function for a new candy bar I haven't seen one in ages so what's this like consolidation that ends up resulting in lower responsiveness to gain customer 
05:30-06:00
and like I said it's in the limit government is simply the largest corporation and Industry is a separate company simply a corporation in the limit it is dealt with Corporation the Monopoly so unless respond to put a customer that's where you have 
06:00-06:30
does not maximize the happiest people which should be our objective overall we had a couple people last night at this event who are joining vitamins couple of the president-elect senior advisors and clearly one of the things heavily on their mind is part of the policy for wants the better term we talked about spending a lot more on recent developments and fostering Innovation big government spending basically 
06:30-07:00
is that kind of national industrial policy of good ideas that a good use of of government right now in your mind and if it is where would you focus that find has responsibility to establish the rules of the game and then ensure that those rules are probably in post like they're like the the referees in the field and football rules the right rules and the referee 
07:00-07:30
and what we actually wants to be for except the long-term maximum happiness of people in future where I think government does not do a great job is when they won. Just be a referee on the field they want to be a player on the field does not is not in a panic 
07:30-08:00
do you favor the game it is a pretty good one that you will be that we're getting rid of all the rules this is very important and that the rules are enforced 
08:00-08:30
other times when you have an unpriced externality such as a CO2 capacity of the oceans and atmosphere so then and effectively then you can get behavior and Industry behavior that does not ugly not good for the environment or not good for the future of the most the time 
08:30-09:00
secret correct behavior from a private industry so if we will see the right behavior and then the government does not try to pick the technology winners and losers you bet your California I have to ask are you you're in Texas right now and there's been speculation that you've been vocal this year 
09:00-09:30
California are you really are you relocating isn't happening and can you talk a little bit about what's been troubling you in California so much this year since you mentioned several operations in California SpaceX is the lodge the last Aerospace company 
09:30-10:00
California plants in California and California to be the center of Aerospace manufacturing last two left so that's very important point to make it for myself yes I I have moved to Texas we've got the Starship developments here in South Texas where I am right now we're hopefully going to do lunch later play today 
10:00-10:30
the big eyed tree Melvin's was it a corporate environment the two biggest things that are both going on right now are the Starship development in South Texas which was done in like 5 years ago and then 
10:30-11:00
u.s. Bank report for Tesla which is go get your texts just I wasn't supposed to use my time here right now is it in Berlin 
11:00-11:30
is there something that happens when 
11:30-12:00
has been wanting for a long time and I think they were taking it for granted little bit what side of the Board of Education in Corporate America in general in the corporate Suite in American companies in fostering in developing and Innovation are the leaders in Corporate America 
12:00-12:30
as much as we might need you to think right now information on the farm tronic Improvement answer is no I think I might advise to spend less time on on finance 
12:30-13:00
I'm blessed I'm in conference rooms last time on PowerPoint and more time just to make your product as amazing as possible and why why why why is it that because bored or more shareholders or where to finance a return focused and don't don't think enough about product is being at the Harding of values because of certain kind of the scale of cultivated 
13:00-13:30
why is that why why why why is there a problem this week I think it might be too many mbas are running companies does the NBA ization of America which I think is maybe not that great it should be more focused on on the product or service itself 
13:30-14:00
I'm on board meetings list time on on financials of assembly of people together create a product or service and deliver their part to service Spectrum allocated resources to create goods and services that are ugly 
14:00-14:30
value than the cost and profit is should just mean over time that the value of the output is worth more than they've been done the inputs product more than the product is good people getting some of the structures coming from the potential side of things 
14:30-15:00
honestly would recommend to Jenny anyone listening that just spend less time in my room last time on on on PowerPoint presentation Westheimer spreadsheet and more time on the factory floor or time with customers is your product as awesome as a kid be what could you do to make it make it rain 
15:00-15:30
and you do it like me make a partner if this is the thing that really matters or is there any elements that somebody has to do it Well. Everybody's going to be thinking 
15:30-16:00
on your scale a lot but but that you hide you look ready to keep something that that is is pretty easily easily learn or Georgia Southern Bowl have you tried if you haven't tried hard try hard I think it is 
16:00-16:30
it's on some mysterious thing it's just basically just being like an absolute perfectionist about the part that you make the services provided speak negative feedback from old quarters you know from Costco's from from people who are constantly okay what do you want cream and I think that's absolutely learnable and if you find yourself spending a lot of time in 
16:30-17:00
just getting presentations and reviewing spreadsheets you're barking up the wrong tree so get out there on the factory floor get out there in the stores both customers what would you love to have a few times 
17:00-17:30
others will let you know that's not really how it works if you don't love it don't expect others will either now you're the moment I want to talk about yourself and you had plenty of ups and down even to this point but it's a high point on your own journey in this way 
17:30-18:00
because you you talk a little bit about being willing to put yourself out there they'll learn keep growing what were turning points for you that really you can help me is that that that you aren't from the bed where you are right now well if I flipped over the steaks and cool 
18:00-18:30
give me some of the things I mentioned it before it's like we're getting presentations and spreadsheets in that picture when I spend too much time in Connors room only when things go awry and when I go and spend time with the factory floor or you know we're really using the the cars 
18:30-19:00
the Rockets it's like the best way things have gone gone better first lady have to be involved I'm going to work that you can't do alligators where you can't trust nobody got one thing to make some executive reluctant we're trying to find out line between showing and trusting their subordinates to do the work so 
19:00-19:30
what is line of townspeople at SpaceX and Tesla and I think the raw is good for sure respect him greatly and it's not hard to work with them and I find that if I am the details 
19:30-20:00
issues this does not result in them feeling better but we're feeling better like you know it's like we might like War the General in some like we know or or on the front lines 
20:00-20:30
what's the procedure on the front lines so nobody believes the prince in the palace get out there yeah me my post office right now 
20:30-21:00
what will talk with me by Tesla on SpaceX today in Stockdale yeah. I guess this 
21:00-21:30
we're kind of debating I should raise money or should we not wasn't sure thing and increase the security of the company will probably a good thing and for less than 1% of solutions probably make sense what is the longest river 
21:30-22:00
are there diamond and I guess to have been more of a Worcester database okay I want to see a couple questions from the audience hello my name is Kathryn Parsons and I see our technology education company. 
22:00-22:30
I want to know machines able to innovate and I think machines will well I will be able to do everything inhuman overtime everything everything okay just one 
22:30-23:00
if you could have the break GZ1 transportation for structure of United States my entire transportation resources while I see it is that we need to go 3-D and cities in order to relieve traffic congestion and I and I think probably the best way to do that is with 
23:00-23:30
tunnels it sounds silly but boring for new companies and I kept saying or how can I get I said this and that so I can be opening up first at commercial center opening up in Vegas on going from the convention center to the 
23:30-24:00
Anika will have an opportunity to try it out and build see that hey if we just go to 3D and cities we don't have to be stuck in gridlock and tunnels and then pool long-distance travel be but if you evacuate the title and and essentially remove the are almost of the are you can you can get rid of everything and you can go supersonic 
24:00-24:30
I do so with it. With no dependents on weather and with no need to get to higher altitude or create a sonic boom issues so that's what I meant. It's just basically a pressurized electric car in the back into so I think it's a business will be a revolution in transport that would be amazing and Oakley 
24:30-25:00
just do it not just boring company here's one you want I was being making demands. Spell squeeze or not sell the government agencies and walk out in protest Google do you think this kind of thing as having a chilling effect or we'll have until I get back 
25:00-25:30
Rolanda stuff is is Saturday in the San Francisco Bay area and I think it was sucking Valley on the San Francisco Bay area has too much influence on the world in my opinion and I say that as someone who has been most of his life in California mostly in the Bay Area 
25:30-26:00
bahria has outside influence in the world so Valley that we're going to see some of that scatter I think we'll see some reduction in the influence of Silicon Valley Valley so 
26:00-26:30
mind viruses your memes that travel very quickly through social media that may or may not be correct and encourage a healthy dialogue so you know there's some out there who just want to shut down one side of debate or another I think we should resist that write a timer for 6 I could go for an hour we didn't even get to 
26:30-27:00
the passion by now but thank you for the time today you thank you thank you
